My config files. These configs/plugins/tools come from these various sites:
https://blog.bugsnag.com/tmux-and-vim/
https://statico.github.io/vim3.html
https://github.com/statico/dotfiles
http://vimsheet.com
https://www.tmuxcheatsheet.com

I'm using zim for my zsh config/plugins. Will be trying out zplug soon.

Vim requires vim-plug
https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

Tmux requires tpm
https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm

## Future
It might be beneficial to use something like docker to create a container for tmux and zsh
and then to just run everything out of that container. This could be useful for getting
up and running quickly on a new machine/server. One of the problems would be having to
essentially install an OS to run my perfered dev env. It'd probably still be smaller than
something like visual studio.
